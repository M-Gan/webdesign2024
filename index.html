    <h1>Three Dog Night</h1>
    <h1>Legends</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Three Dog Night is an American rock band formed in 1967, founded by vocalists Chuck Negron, Cory Wells, and Danny
        Hutton. This lineup was soon augmented by Jimmy Greenspoon (keyboards), Joe Schermie (bass), Michael Allsup
        (guitar), and Floyd Sneed (drums). The band had 21 Billboard Top 40 hits between 1969 and 1975, with three
        hitting number one. Three Dog Night recorded many songs written by outside songwriters, and they helped to
        introduce mainstream audiences to writers such as Randy Newman ("Mama Told Me Not to Come"), Paul Williams ("An
        Old Fashioned Love Song"), and Hoyt Axton ("Joy to the World", "Never Been to Spain").</p>
    <p>The commentary included in the CD set Celebrate: The Three Dog Night Story, 1965–1975 states that vocalist Danny
        Hutton's girlfriend, actress June Fairchild (best known as the "Ajax Lady" from the Cheech and Chong movie Up In
        Smoke) suggested the name after reading a magazine article about Aboriginal Australians, in which it was
        explained that on cold nights they would customarily sleep while embracing a dingo, a native species of wild
        dog. On colder nights they would sleep with two dogs and, if the night were freezing, it was a "three dog
        night".</p>
    <h2>Brand's Name Origin</h2>
    <p>Musician Van Dyke Parks, an arranger at Warner Bros Records, disputed the above story and said he coined the
        name. On 10 September 2018, he wrote on Twitter, "I wuz nuts about Hutton's girlfriend. Quite a dancer. Yet, she
        didn't read Mankind magazine, nor have an inkling of anthtopology and the cold aboriginal nights that inspired
        my suggestion."</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The three vocalists, Hutton (who got his start with Hanna-Barbera Records in 1964), Negron, and Wells (who landed
        a recording contract with Dunhill Records) first came together in 1967. They initially went by the name Redwood
        and made some recordings with Brian Wilson while the Beach Boys were working on the album Wild Honey.</p>
    <p>Redwood was briefly poised to be one of the first artists signed to the Beach Boys' Brother Records. According to
        Beach Boy Mike Love, "I had them in the studio for several days, and he was really funny. They didn't meet up to
        his expectations. ... They'd go in and they wouldn't sing well enough for him. ... but they went off and made
        billions." Wilson attempted to produce an album for Redwood, but after the recording of three songs, including
        "Time to Get Alone" and "Darlin'", this motion was halted by his bandmates, who wanted Brian to focus on the
        Beach Boys' contractual obligations. According to Negron, due to the commercial failure of Smiley Smile and
        Wilson's waning commitment to his band, "the other Beach Boys wanted Brian's immense songwriting and producing
        talents used strictly to enhance their own careers". Negron later noted that he would have acted similarly had
        he been in the same position as the Beach Boys.</p>
    <p>Shortly after abandoning the Redwood moniker in 1968, the vocalists hired a group of backing musicians – Ron
        Morgan on guitar, Floyd Sneed on drums, Joe Schermie from the Cory Wells Blues Band on bass, and Jimmy
        Greenspoon on keyboards – and soon took the name Three Dog Night. Morgan left the band before its first album
        was recorded and subsequently joined the Electric Prunes. Michael Allsup was quickly recruited to replace Morgan
        on guitar.</p><h2>Original Band Members</h2>
